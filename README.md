# Robot-arm-3D-
This 3D model represents a robotic arm designed using Tinkercad, a browser-based 3D modeling tool. The arm features a simple, articulated structure that mimics the joints of an industrial robotic manipulator.



Main Components:
Base Platform:
A large circular base provides stable support for the arm. It serves as the foundation and is critical for balance and rotation.

Rotating Lower Arm:
Connected to the base, the first cylindrical segment rotates vertically, allowing up-and-down movement. It simulates the shoulder joint of the robot.

Middle Joint (Elbow):
The second joint allows bending in the middle of the arm, resembling an elbow for greater flexibility.

Upper Arm and Gripper:
The upper segments extend outward and end in a dual-finger gripper, allowing the robot to grab or hold objects. The fingers are rectangular, designed for simple pinching actions.

Color Coding:
The model uses green and white to differentiate moving parts and joints, improving visual understanding of the structure and mobility.

Label:
The name "Robot arm" is added as a 3D text label on the platform, making the project easily identifiable.
